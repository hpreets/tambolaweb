        <p class="mt-3">This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you
            visit this site.</p>
        <p>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT </p>
        <p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information
            about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.
            Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages that you view, what
            websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We
            refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” You may register to join the Service
            directly via the Site or by logging into your account with certain third party social networking services
            (including, but not limited to, Google or Facebook) (“SNS”) via our Site. If you choose to register via an SNS,
            we will use the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your “real” name, email address and
            other information you make publicly available via the SNS) to create your account; the information we extract
            may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. Other than what we may share with the SNS as described
            below, the Personal Information an SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Service, and
            SikhiTambola is not responsible for its accuracy, legality, or non-infringement.</p>
        <p> For transferring winning amount to winner, we also ask for UPI Id. Providing such information is optional and in
            that case, the winning amount will not be paid.</p>
        <p> We collect Device Information using the following technologies: - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on
            your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies,
            and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. - “Log files” track actions occurring on the
            Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages,
            and date/time stamps. - “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information
            about how you browse the Site. When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking
            both about Device Information and Order Information. </p>
        <p></p>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION? </p>
        <p></p>We use this Order Information to: Communicate with you; We use the Device Information that we collect to help
        us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize
        our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to
        assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns). </p>
        <p>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION </p>
        <p> We use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site--you can read more about how Google
            uses your Personal Information here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. You can also opt-out of
            Google Analytics here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Finally, we may also share your Personal
            Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other
            lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>
        <p>DO NOT TRACK</p>
        <p> Please note that we do not alter our Site’s data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal
            from your browser.</p>
        <p>YOUR RIGHTS</p>
